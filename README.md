# AoC-2022

Advent of Code solutions for 2022 (mostly in Python). Fingers crossed we can learn some Haskell along the way.

## Structure

For each day, there will be the following files:

- `day-x-prompt.txt`
- `day-x-input.txt`
- `day-x.py`

## Selected Learnings

Thoughts, observations, and eurekas for each day.

#### Day 19
- Created an entire custom class which overloaded +, *, <=, etc. Could have just used a 4-Tuple, which already works intuitively.
- Main issue is reducing the problem space to a reasonable size. Heuristics are necessary, at least from what I can tell (no obvious, optimal solution that is fast).
